title: "3D Printed Stealth Drone"
excerpt: "I am desiging and testing a custom 3D printed drone that I have designed with low observability in mind. For this particular portfolio item, I will not show images until it is complete as to keep particular fabrication and assembly techniques to myself. The drone makes use of multiple well known and some sparsely known stealth techniques, and will undergoe testing at various radar frequencies."

Stealth is the single most important quality a modern military aircraft can have, as in our world of beyond line-of-sight combat and advanced detection and tracking systems, stealth is not a feature, but a requirement. As an electrical engineer, I have always had a keen interest in the operating principles behind stealth technology, as I thought the ability to “manipulate” electromagnetic waves was interesting.

Due to my rather large personal library, I was already in a good position to learn about various stealth technologies, as I have several books that cover various techniques. Due to the nature of these technologies, the internet is not a very reliable source of information, as when classified technologies are involved, the information quality of the internet drastically deteriorates.

The main books I used to aid in my designs where “[Radar and Laser Cross Section Engineering, 3rd Ed](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105630)” by David C. Jenn, and “[Introduction to Aeronautics: A Design Perspective, 3rd Ed](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.103278).” By Brandt, Stiles, Bertin and Whitford. These texts assisted in making design consideration for my aircraft and helped me come up with my own ideas to improve my aircraft’s RCS. I made use of several other texts to help me in developing Radar Absorbent Materials, and some additional techniques such as plasma stealth.
