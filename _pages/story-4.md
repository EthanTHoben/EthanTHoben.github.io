While I am an electrical engineer by trade, I still have a distinct interest in many fields. I collect information that I view to be useful, and nothing is more useful than medicine.

The book "Cowan & Steel's Manual for the Identification of Medical Bacteria" by Cowan came into my possesion in the same way many of my books do, from the [Downtown Huntsville Friends of the Library](https://hmcpl.org/FOL/downtown). Upon cataloging this book, I found the personal library stamp of one Michael G. Rinaldi.
