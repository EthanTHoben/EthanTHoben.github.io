I created this website both as a convenient way to keep track the things I get up to, and as a way to show others what I'm about.

Who am I?
======
Once again, my name is Ethan Hoben, and I am a thinker and a creator at heart. Due to these qualities of mine, I knew very early on in my life that I wanted to be involved in designing and buidling things, and I very quickly settled on engineering as my best path to acheive my goals. Later on, I was able to find a passion for electronics, which narrowed my focus to electrical engineering, which is what I pursued and continue to pursue at university. However, I am a very curious and big-picture thinker, so while my main interests are in electronics, I have also taken an explicit interest in computer science, chemical engineering, mechanical and aerospace engineering, computer engineering, etc. Basically, if a topic can be of use to me in some way, I tend to pursue it.

What am I currently up to?
======
I am currently a software engineer at Northrop Grumman Space Systems for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense program, and I work on the Fire Control team. For some more information on what this program provides for the United States, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-Based_Midcourse_Defense). I am also currently a part-time graduate electrical engineering student at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and plan to graduate in summer 2025. In my freetime, I like to spend time with friends, build advanced rockets, and juggle my many ongoing projects. I am also a amateur librarian, more info about that can be found about that [here](https://ethanthoben.github.io//lb/).

What is on this site?
======
This website is my current archive and display of the various things I get up to. On this site, you will see a bar of tabs at the top, each of which will take you to a different page with more details on each tab's topic. In general though, this site contains my up-to-date CV, my current portfolio of projects, my various talks and presentations I have given, the organizations and societies I am apart of, honors and awards I have been presented with, and information regarding my personal technical library that I curate. Feel free to poke around, and if you have any burning questions, my email is listed on the left side of this homepage.

5 Fun Facts
======
* I own 5 3D printers, and when they all run it is very loud
* I own a dinosaur bone fragement from a *Dromaeosaurus* (AKA a Raptor) that was flown to space and back on the 15th flight of Blue Origin's New Shepard Rocket. My fragment is number 34 of 103. More info on how I got my hands on that [here](https://ethanthoben.github.io//service/).
* I am an avid pin collector, and have 3 full display cases of pins, most of which are from various space organizations, such as NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, etc. I also have various pins from various US defense contractors and their various programs, many of which came from my grandmother.
* My favorite picture ever is known to some as "The Smartest Picture in History" and is of the 1927 Solvay Conference on Electrons and Photons attendees. I have a canvas print of this prominetly displayed, and view it as a reminder of who layed the foundation of our understanding of the universe. If interested, [here](https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/solvay-conference-probably-intelligent-picture-ever-taken-1927/) is some info on the picture.
* If I wasnt an engineer, it is highly likely I would be a lawyer.
