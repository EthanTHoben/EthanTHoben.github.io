My connection to Phillip Slater starts as most of my stories do, with me looking for awesome books to add to my collection. I was on Ebay a Thursday afternoon in November, 2024, browsing as I normally do. This time, I was looking for NASA-SP publications to add to my collection, I have several texts and collections from NASA and I am a big nerd.

I browsed for a bit, and found a listing for vintage NASA books, 4 of them, 3 of which where NASA-SP publications. The price was fair, so I purchased them. Additionally, the description said these books were signed, which is always a treat and adds some history to the books. A week later, the books arrived at my door, and I unboxed them. However, I did not immediately look inside or catalog them, as I had to leave for conference in North Carolina the next morning, so I had to back and get to bed.

A couple weeks go by, and I am busy as always, and accidently place some papers on top of the books on my desk, which hid them from me for a further week or so, until I got the chance to clean up my desk. When I finally looked, 2 books in particular caught my eye. These books were NASA SP-349, "Pioneer Odyssey", and a small paperback titled "...for the benefit of all mankind". Pictures of both are below:

...for the benefit of all mankind, this one held some surprises.

In the cover of Pioneer Odyssey, there was inscription to Phil and a signature from one Charlie Blenman, who appears to have been a program manager on some aspect of the Pioneer program. Further in the book, another inscription to Phil and signature is from William Swindell, one of the authors of the book. Both inscriptions are dates to January 18th, 1978. Pictures of both inscriptions are below:

Charlie Blenman's Inscription. Phil was the associate director of the Optical Sciences Center at the University of Arizona at the time, and appears to have helped quite alot with the pioneer 10 spacecraft.

William Swindell's Inscription. William worked at the OSC with Phil, and they were likely colleagues.

We will get back to Phil's career and accomplishments, of which their are many. However, a very interesting surprise was waiting in the cover of the paperback copt of "...for the benefit of all mankind". When I opened the book to get catalog details, some papers fell out. This is not unusual for my, I find notes, old homework, etc. in books all the time, comes with the used book territory. However, I have never found sonething like this. What fell out of the book was 3 postcards from the Apollo 17 launch in 1972. Furthermore, one of the postcards was not just memorabilia, but was a handwritten card from Phil to his daughter, Elizabeth. Here are some pictures:

Phil's postcard to his daughter, Elizabeth. He mentions that he met up with Elizabeths uncle and aunt from the british embassy (Phil is british by the way) and that they are all sitting on the grass 3.5 miles away from the launch pad 2 hours from launch in December, 1972.
