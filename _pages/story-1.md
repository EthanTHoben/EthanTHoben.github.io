My connection to Phillip Slater starts as most of my stories do, with me looking for awesome books to add to my collection. I was on Ebay a Thursday afternoon in November, 2024, browsing as I normally do. This time, I was looking for NASA-SP publications to add to my collection, I have several texts and collections from NASA and I am a big nerd.

I browsed for a bit, and found a listing for vintage NASA books, 4 of them, 3 of which where NASA-SP publications. The price was fair, so I purchased them. Additionally, the description said these books were signed, which is always a treat and adds some history to the books. A week later, the books arrived at my door, and I unboxed them. However, I did not immediatly look inside or catalog them, as I had to leave for conference in North Carolina the next morning, so I had to back and get to bed.

A couple weeks go by, and I am busy as always, and accidently place some papers on top of the books on my desk, which hid them from me for a further week or so, until I got the chance to clean up my desk. When I finally looked, 2 books in particular caught my eye.
