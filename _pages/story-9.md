The book "Intuitive IC Op Amps" is a title I have had for a while, and is an excellent resource on operational amplifier principles and applications. The book is by Thomas M. Frederiksen, and was published in 1984. This particular copy is unique, however, as the book bears the stamp of one Interep Associates, Inc. Interep is a manufactures representative for the electronics industry, who's buisness model seeks to unite customers with manufacturers. Interep covers most of the southern United States, and have been in buisness since 1974.
