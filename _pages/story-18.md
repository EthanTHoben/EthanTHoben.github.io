I have many collections inside my library. As a certified nerd, it is an impulse of mine to finish any collection I start, and when it comes to books, that often means me chasing down what amount to long lost tomes to finish a collection from before my grandparents where even alive. While this can be frustrating at times, it is also very rewarding. I am happy to be the steward of these texts, such that they continue on through time after me.

One of my more elusive collections is that of "Principles of Guided Missiles Design", the editor of which was Grayson Merrill. The collection starts in 1955, and contains several volumes, all of which are rare and difficult to come by in 2024. However, the most sought after volume, the Guidance volume by Arthur Locke, was my main priority.

I was able to get my hands on it in December 2024, and I immediatly cataloged and began reading through it. It is always amazing to me how much information can really fit into a well written book, and Guidance does not dissapoint. I flipped to a random page around the middle of the book, and found, lets say, intersting information, but that is a story for another time. Additonally, I noticed a personal stamp in the inside cover.

This stamp was from one Otakar P. Prachar, and the following is a compilation of my research on his life, career, and ingeunity.
