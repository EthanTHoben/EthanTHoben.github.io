I have many collections inside my library. As a certified nerd, it is an impulse of mine to finish any collection I start, and when it comes to books, that often means me chasing down what amount to long lost tomes to finish a collection from before my grandparents where even alive. While this can be frustrating at times, it is also very rewarding. I am happy to be the steward of these texts, such that they continue on through time after me.

One of my more elusive collections is that of "Principles of Guided Missiles Design", the editor of which was Grayson Merrill. The collection starts in 1955, and contains several volumes, all of which are rare and difficult to come by in 2024. However, the most sought after volume, the Guidance volume by Arthur Locke, was my main priority.

I was able to get my hands on it in December 2024, and I immediatly cataloged and began reading through it. It is always amazing to me how much information can really fit into a well written book, and Guidance does not dissapoint. I flipped to a random page around the middle of the book, and found, lets say, intersting information, but that is a story for another time. Additonally, I noticed a personal stamp in the inside cover.

This stamp was from one Otakar P. Prachar, and the following is a compilation of my research on his life, career, and ingeunity.

Otakar, who went by Prach, was born in 1912 to a Czech immigrant family in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He grew up in Willow River on a farm, where his father was a beekeeper. The farm was plentiful with wild blueberries, and Otokar's sister credits the bluberries with his and her longevity.

Early on, Prach showed that he had a knack for creativity and creation, becoming a skilled woodworker as a child. At the age of 16, he built a fine violin modeled on classical designs. He went on to attend the University of Minnesota, where he graduated with a bachelor's in engineering and a master's in physics. In 1941, he would marry Lydia Emma Erickson, a fellow graduate of the university.

Upon graduation, Prach began his career with Allis-Chalmers in Milwaukee, an american industrial giant who manufactured industrial equipment across many industries. Allis-Chalmers was sold off due to finacial struggles in the 1990s

After a brief stint at Allis-Chalmers, Prach moved to Indianapolis in 1940 where he worked for Allison, a division of General Motors. During World War 2, Prach was involved in modifying the Allison V-1710 engine, which was used extensivly in the famed P-51 Mustang and several other fighter planes in service at the time. Prach would go on to patent several engine designs related to the V-1710, and worked on many post-war turbo-jet and other aeronautical engine designs.
