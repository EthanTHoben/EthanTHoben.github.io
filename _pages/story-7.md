I have been collecting the International Series of Monographs in Aeronautics and Astronautics for some time now. The series dates back to the 1950's, and features some of the biggest names in Aeronatuics and Astronautics, including Von Karman himself. I have several stories related to my collection and research of this series, and those can be found on this website. However, some of the titles I have collected come from some pretty interesting places.

Part of the International Series of Monographs in Aeronautics and Astronautics Divsions 3 on Propulsion Systems Including Fuels is a text titled Jet Propulsion Fuels. I got my hands on an original copy of this 1961 work in mid 2024, and have enjoyed it ever since. The author is one Nikandr Andreevich Ragozin, a Russian engineer or scientist. Unfortunatley, I was unable to find much about Ragozin, and this tracks considering the time period and the state of Russian, the then Soviet Union's heart. The book was translated, printed, and bound by the [Pergamon Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergamon_Press), one of my favorite dearly departed publishers. The Pergamon Press was sold off in 1991, but remains a historical titan of scientific and technical publishing.
