I am a Pennsylvainia native, but have been in Huntsville, AL ever since I started my undergrad here in 2019. The greatest benefit of living in Huntsville is that we have so many engineers its hard to find people who arnt engineers. This laid the foundation for one of my greates discoveries, the [Downtown Huntsville Friends of the Library](https://hmcpl.org/FOL/downtown). I have likely cleaned out this bookstore's STEM section multiple times now, and I have no intention of stopping. One of the coolest books I have found there, however, is a text called "EMP Interaction: Principles, Techniques, and Reference Data" by K. S. H. Lee.

While this book is cool on its own, the coolest part about it is it's prior owner, Glenn A. Shelby. When I first opened the cover, I thought that Glenn may have been related to Senator Shelby, but I quickly proved myself wrong with a google search. However, I was interested and decided to fork up $80 dollars, which is alot at a used bookstore where the average cost is $2, and brought it home. After looking through the book some more, I found not just Glenn's signature, but a custom personal library stamp embossed into a page.
