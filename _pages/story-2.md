I am a Pennsylvainia native, but have been in Huntsville, AL ever since I started my undergrad here in 2019. The greatest benefit of living in Huntsville is that we have so many engineers its hard to find people who arnt engineers. This laid the foundation for one of my greates discoveries, the [Downtown Huntsville Friends of the Library](https://hmcpl.org/FOL/downtown). I have likely cleaned out this bookstore's STEM section multiple times now, and I have no intention of stopping. One of the coolest books I have found there, however, is a text called "EMP Interaction: Principles, Techniques, and Reference Data" by K. S. H. Lee.

While this book is cool on its own, the coolest part about it is it's prior owner, Glenn A. Shelby. When I first opened the cover, I thought that Glenn may have been related to Senator Shelby, but I quickly proved myself wrong with a google search. However, I was interested and decided to fork up $80 dollars, which is alot at a used bookstore where the average cost is $2, and brought it home. After looking through the book some more, I found not just Glenn's signature, but a custom personal library stamp embossed into a page.

I decided to research Glenn more, and unfortunately found his [obituary](https://www.hazelgreenfuneralhome.com/obituary/Glenn-Shelby). Glenn passed away in 2015 at the age of 51. The following is a recounting of my research into Glenn A. Shelby's life, education, and career.

Glenn A. Shelby was born in 1963 in Paducah, KY, and graduated from Ballard County Kentucky High School in 1981. He then went on the attend Murray State University with a Bachelors Degree in Physics Engineering in 1986. He then went on to attend the University of Alabama in Huntsville, earning his Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering.

Upon his graduation from Murray State, Glenn began his professional career as an electrical engineer with the Nichols Research Corporation in Huntsville, AL. Glenn joined the Nichols Research Corporation at a time when the company was rapidly growing with a windfall from former President Ronald Reagan's [Strategic Defense Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative), also know at the Star Wars Program. Interestingly enough, I worked on the [Ground Based Midcourse Defense system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-Based_Midcourse_Defense), which is the succesor to the Star Wars Program, small world.

Glenn worked at the Nichols Research Corporation for 14 years, and he primarily worked on the [Patriot Missile System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot) program as an electromagnetic environmental effects engineer. During the Gulf war, the technology that Glenn had a hand in building gained worldwide recognition as the guidance systems from the Nichols Research Corporation allowed patriot missiles to intercept Iraqi Scud missiles.

Another intersting coincidence is that during my college internship at UAH, I worked on a program called [IBCS](https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/land/integrated-battle-command-system-ibcs), aka the Integrated Battle Command system, and once again crossed paths with Glenn's work, as I had some dealings with Patriot Systems.
