The Theory of Transonic Flow by K. G. Guderley and translated J. R. Moszynski was added into my collection as part of the International Series of Monographs in Aeronautics and Astronautics. This copy was found by me on eBay, which is a common origin for alot of my more obscure books. While the original text is in german, the Pergamon Press translated the work for wider consumption, and was printed and bound in the U.S. by Addison-Wesley Publishing Company in 1962. The Author, is a somewhat famous researcher who has a problem names after him, called the [Guderley–Landau–Stanyukovich problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guderley%E2%80%93Landau%E2%80%93Stanyukovich_problem). The problem concerns the time evolution of converging shock waves, and more can be seen about it on the linked site. Even so, this text is now a part of my collection, but I am not the first person to own it. Before me, it appears that Boeing was in possestion of this text, more specifically the Boeing Transport Division Library.
