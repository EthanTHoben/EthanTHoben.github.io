I have many collections, and I start new ones frequently. I have a knack for collecting, so I always make an effort to complete any collection I start. I make it a point to only collect original prints, and do not collect reprints, even if the content may be the same. I do this as the history of the book, whether that be the previous owner, library or buisness, is just as important to me as an amatuer librarian and historian. You could say its half the fun.

That being said, I have listed my in-progress collections below. Enjoy!

## AIAA Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics

The AIAA [Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics](https://arc.aiaa.org/action/showPublications?pubType=book&seriesKey=4.ps&AfterYear=1960&BeforeYear=2024&queryID=33/876625270) collection focuses on texts that present a particular, well-defined subject reflecting the advacnes in the fields of aerospace science, engineering, and technology. The collection is maintained by the [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://www.aiaa.org/), of which I am a member. The collection has 268 volumes currently, with new texts being added frequently. The collection dates back to 1960, with volume 1, titled Solid Propellant Rocket Research, which compiled many cutting edge papers on solid rocket propulsion and related fields, edited by Martin Summerfield. Originally, the collection was titled Progress in Astronautics and Rocketry, but in 1963 the collection title was changed to the Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics, which acted as an extension of the original 8 volumes. I have a long way to go to finish the collection, but I like to think of it as more of a marathon than a sprint.

## AIAA Education Series

The AIAA [Education Series](https://arc.aiaa.org/series/4.es) publishes books that are adopted for classroom use in many of the top undergraduate and graduate engineering programs around the world. These texts are also referred to on a daily basis by aeronautics and astronautics professionals who wish to hone their craft. Books in this series are designed to teach the content effectivly, making them ideal to expand ones understaing of a broad range of topics. The first text in the series is titled "Aerothermodynamics of Aircraft Engine Components", by Gordon C. Oates in 1985. Since then, 142 titles have been published, all of which are excellent resources.

I currently have 5 of these titles, which are listed below:
* [Radar Electronic Warfare](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.403225), 1988
* [Optimal Control Theory with Aerospace Applications](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.867347), 2010

* [Radar and Laser Cross Section Engineering](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105630), 2019

## International Series of Monographs in Aeronautics and Astronautics 

The International Series of Monographs in Aeronautics and Astronautics was a series published by the Pergamon Press starting in 1958. The series was composed of publications from Aeronautics and Astronautics professionals all over the world, and many of the titles are translated from their original language. The Series was chaired by famed engineer Theodore Von Karman and Hugh Latimer Dryden. The honorary advisory board included famous names like Wernher Von Braun and Charles Stark Draper. Information on the series is sparse, and it is has not been in production for a long time. Based on the texts I have in my collection, the series is comprised of 20 volumes. I have found titles that are part of the series from later dates, but until I have them and the amended list of volumes, I will go with what I have confirmed.

I currently have 5 of these titles, which are listed below:
* The Theory of Transonic Flow
* Progress in Combustions Science and Technology Vol. 1
* Jet Propulsion Fuels
* Inertial Guidance
* Aircraft Stability and Control

## Principles of Guided Missile Design

The Principles of Guided Missile Design series is a highly sought after and rare collection. The Series dates back to 1955, when the first volume, Guidance, by Arthur Locke was published. To date, the series has a total of 13 titles. Most of these titles are either very difficult to find, or very expensive to get your hands on, from the hundereds to even thousands of dollars. I currently have 4 of the 13 titles, and am on the lookout for the rest. I have found that 2 of the titles are nowhere to be found online, which will complicate completing the series, but I will figure it out.

As mentioned, I have 4 of the titles in this series, they are listed below:
* Guidance
* Operations Research, Armament, Launching
* Space Flight Volume 1, Environment and Celestial Mechanics
* Airborne Radar

## The Bell Telephone Laboratories Series

The Bell Telephone Laboratories Series is a series published by the famous Bell Labs in the 1940s and was continued until at least the 1960s. The publications come from fields like elctromagnetics to material science, and where written by titans of modern science, such as William Shockely, father of the transistor. The collection list I have has 30 titles.

I currently have X titles in my collection. They are listed below:





## Dover Books on Engineering

The Dover Books on Engineering series is a collection of various texts that covered engineering topics of high interest across multiple fields. While the series has expanded and split off into multiple sub-series in the modern day, my first collection goal is that of the original series set as found in the title Theory of Wing Sections. The original series is comprised of 28 volumes, of which I have most.
