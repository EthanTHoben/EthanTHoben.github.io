I have no clue how this book ended up in my hands, but its fortunate that it did. The book "Radio Engineering" by Frederick Terman, published in 1937, and it is an excellent text that reflects the progression of electromagnetic engineering and our applications of that knowledge. But this book was not orignally mine, but rather the personal copy of one Lt. Robert H. Courtney Jr.
